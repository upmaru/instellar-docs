**Welcome to Instellar!**

Instellar is a continuous deployment platform that will allow developers to manage deployments without relying on DevOps Engineer. It enables developers to setup their own *Platform as a Service* in a consistent manner without needing any complex tools. This documentation will guide any developer to quickly setup their own servers for simple single server deployments all the way to multi machine cluster that can scale to infinity and beyond.

## Getting Started

To get started with this theme, check out the `README.md` in your new project directory. It provides documentation on how to use and customize this template for your own project. Keep the README around so that you can always refer back to it as you build.

Found a missing feature that you can't live without? Please suggest it on Discord [(#ideas-and-suggestions channel)](https://astro.build/chat) and even consider adding it yourself on GitHub! Astro is an open source project and contributions from developers like you are how we grow!

Good luck out there, Astronaut. üßë‚ÄçüöÄ
